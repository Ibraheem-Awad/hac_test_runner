# hac_test_runner
A program that was written in python to help the students in my college in their homework

With this program you can:
1. Make test files, for both your sol and teacher sol
2. Diff between yor sol, and teacher sol
3. Tar your files

## How to Use ##
Copy and paste the runner.py in your NoMachine, and run it using terminal
For example: python ruuner.py

You can choose different actions from the menu so it's fairly easy to use.

IMPORTANT: All files must be in the same directory where the runner.py is.

## Making Tests ##

After selecting the first option, you will have 3 options:
1. Teacher Tests
2. Your Tests
3. Both

Teacher Sol must end with sol in the end of its name, example: ex1asol
Your Sol must be the same name but without sol uin the end of it, example: ex1a
And finally .in files must have a valid name, example:
ex1a_test00.in

After you select which sol you want to make tests for, you will get .out files.
